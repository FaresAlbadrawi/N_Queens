# N-Queens Game

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the N-Queens problem using the Tkinter library. The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This implementation includes both an automated solver and an interactive game where users can place and remove queens manually.
